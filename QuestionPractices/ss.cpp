// Arrays

// Reverse an array

// Find min/max element

// Rotate array by k steps

// Remove duplicates from sorted array

// Find missing number from 1..n 

// Strings

// Check palindrome

// Reverse a string without using extra functions

// Count vowels/consonants

// Find first non-repeating character

// Check if two strings are anagrams

// Functions

// Write a function to calculate factorial (recursive + iterative)

// Write a function to find GCD of two numbers

// Write a function to count digits / sum of digits

// OOPS (in C++/Java/C#)

// Difference between class & object

// Constructor & Destructor

// Function overloading vs overriding

// Inheritance types (single, multiple, hierarchical, hybrid)

// Polymorphism (compile time vs runtime)

// Abstraction vs Encapsulation

// Interface vs Abstract Class (important for C#/.NET)

// Data Structures

// Stack & Queue implementation using array

// Linked List basics (insert, delete, traverse)

// Binary Tree basics (preorder, inorder, postorder traversal)

// Hashing ‚Äì why it‚Äôs used, advantages

// Time complexity of searching & sorting algorithms

// üîπ 2. Interview Questions (C#, .NET, OOP Focus)

// Since the profile is .NET, even if test is general, interview will include C# and .NET concepts:

// C# / .NET Questions

// What is .NET Framework / .NET Core?

// Difference between C and C#

// What are value types and reference types in C#?

// Explain CLR, CTS, CLS in .NET

// What is garbage collection in C#?

// Difference between stack and heap memory

// What are properties in C#?

// What is namespace?

// Difference between interface and abstract class in C#

// What are sealed classes?

// OOPS in C#

// What is polymorphism? Examples in C#

// What is encapsulation? Give real-life example

// What is multiple inheritance and why C# does not support it directly?

// How does C# achieve multiple inheritance? (via Interfaces)

// üîπ 3. HR & Company-Related Questions

// They may ask general fresher HR questions:

// Tell me about yourself.

// Why do you want to work in .NET profile?

// Difference between C++ and C# ‚Äì why do you want to shift to C#?

// Why should we hire you as a fresher?

// Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

// Do you prefer working in frontend, backend, or full stack?

// Also, research their company domain:

// If they are an IT service-based company, expect:
// ‚ÄúWe develop solutions for clients in different domains (finance, healthcare, retail). As a fresher, you‚Äôll be trained on .NET and deployed to projects.‚Äù

// Prepare to say:
// ‚ÄúI want to work in .NET because it is widely used in enterprise applications, scalable, and secure. I am interested in backend development with C# and SQL.‚Äù

// üîπ 4. Last-Minute Strategy

// Revise C++/C basics (for test)

// Revise C#/.NET basics (for interview)

// Practice writing small codes quickly (focus on logic, not style)

// Be ready with 2 mini-projects or academic projects to discuss

// Keep resume points prepared (they might ask about DSA, C++, or projects you listed)
